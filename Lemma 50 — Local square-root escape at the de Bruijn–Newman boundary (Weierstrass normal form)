Lemma 50 — Local square-root escape at the de Bruijn–Newman boundary (Weierstrass normal form)

Setup. Let \Xi_\lambda(t) denote the de Bruijn–Newman family (the heat-flow deformation of \Xi(t)), with the standard properties:
	1.	For each fixed \lambda\in\mathbb R, t\mapsto \Xi_\lambda(t) is an entire function and is real-valued on \mathbb R.
	2.	The map (t,\lambda)\mapsto \Xi_\lambda(t) is real-analytic on \mathbb R\times \mathbb R and extends to a function analytic in t and real-analytic in \lambda in a neighborhood of any (t_*,\lambda_*).

(These are the standard analytic regularity properties of the de Bruijn–Newman deformation.)

Statement
Suppose there exists (t_*,\lambda_*)\in\mathbb R^2 such that

\Xi_{\lambda_*}(t_*) = 0,\qquad \partial_t \Xi_{\lambda_*}(t_*) = 0,\qquad \partial_{tt}\Xi_{\lambda_*}(t_*)\neq 0,
\tag{50.1}

and the parameter is transversal at the vanishing point:

\partial_\lambda \Xi_\lambda(t)\big|_{(t_*,\lambda_*)}\neq 0.
\tag{50.2}

Then there exist neighborhoods U of t_* and J of \lambda_* and two analytic functions r(\lambda), s(\lambda) on J, with

r(\lambda_*)=0,\qquad s(\lambda_*)=0,\qquad s'(\lambda_*)\neq 0,
\tag{50.3}

and a nonvanishing analytic unit U(t,\lambda)\neq 0 on U\times J, such that

\Xi_\lambda(t)=U(t,\lambda)\Big((t-t_* - r(\lambda))^2 - s(\lambda)\Big)
\quad\text{for all }(t,\lambda)\in U\times J.
\tag{50.4}

In particular, the zeros of \Xi_\lambda in U are exactly

t_\pm(\lambda)=t_* + r(\lambda) \pm \sqrt{s(\lambda)},
\tag{50.5}

with the square root taken on a local branch.

Moreover, since s'(\lambda_*)\neq 0, we have the square-root law

t_\pm(\lambda)=t_* + r(\lambda) \pm \sqrt{s'(\lambda_*)}\,\sqrt{\lambda-\lambda_*}\;+\;O(\lambda-\lambda_*),
\tag{50.6}

and hence:
	•	If s(\lambda)>0, both zeros t_\pm(\lambda) are real and split on the real axis.
	•	If s(\lambda)<0, the two zeros form a complex conjugate pair, with
\Im\,t_\pm(\lambda)\asymp \sqrt{|s(\lambda)|}\asymp \sqrt{|\lambda-\lambda_*|}.
\tag{50.7}

Proof
Step 1 (Order-2 zero gives a quadratic Weierstrass factor).
Fix (t_*,\lambda_*) satisfying (50.1). Because t\mapsto \Xi_{\lambda_*}(t) is entire and has a zero of exact multiplicity 2 at t=t_* (since \Xi(t_*)=0, \Xi_t(t_*)=0, but \Xi_{tt}(t_*)\neq 0), Weierstrass preparation (in the variable t, with parameter \lambda) yields:

There exists a neighborhood U\times J of (t_*,\lambda_*), an analytic unit U(t,\lambda)\neq 0 on U\times J, and analytic functions a(\lambda), b(\lambda) on J such that

\Xi_\lambda(t)=U(t,\lambda)\Big((t-t_*)^2 + a(\lambda)(t-t_*) + b(\lambda)\Big),
\tag{50.8}

with

a(\lambda_*)=0,\qquad b(\lambda_*)=0.
\tag{50.9}

Step 2 (Complete the square).
Define
r(\lambda):=-\frac{a(\lambda)}{2},\qquad s(\lambda):=r(\lambda)^2 - b(\lambda).
\tag{50.10}
Then
(t-t_*)^2 + a(\lambda)(t-t_*) + b(\lambda)
= (t-t_* - r(\lambda))^2 - s(\lambda),
\tag{50.11}
so (50.8) becomes exactly (50.4). Since a(\lambda_* )=b(\lambda_* )=0, we obtain r(\lambda_* )=0 and s(\lambda_* )=0.

Step 3 (Transversality forces s'(\lambda_*)\neq 0).
Differentiate (50.8) in \lambda and evaluate at (t_*,\lambda_*). At t=t_*, the quadratic factor equals 0 (because b(\lambda_*)=0), so the unit U(t,\lambda) contributes nothing to first order at that point, and we get

\partial_\lambda \Xi_\lambda(t)\big|_{(t_*,\lambda_*)}
= U(t_*,\lambda_*)\, b'(\lambda_*).
\tag{50.12}

By assumption (50.2), the left-hand side is nonzero; and U(t_*,\lambda_*)\neq 0. Hence

b'(\lambda_*)\neq 0.
\tag{50.13}

Now compute s'(\lambda_*). From (50.10), s(\lambda)=r(\lambda)^2-b(\lambda), and r(\lambda_*)=0, so

s'(\lambda_*) = 2r(\lambda_*)r'(\lambda_*) - b'(\lambda_*) = -b'(\lambda_*).
\tag{50.14}

Therefore s'(\lambda_*)\neq 0, establishing (50.3).

Step 4 (Square-root branches).
By (50.4), zeros of \Xi_\lambda in U are exactly the solutions of
(t-t_* - r(\lambda))^2 = s(\lambda),
hence (50.5). Since s(\lambda_*)=0 and s'(\lambda_*)\neq 0, we have the local expansion
s(\lambda)=s'(\lambda_*)(\lambda-\lambda_*)+O((\lambda-\lambda_*)^2),
\tag{50.15}
so taking a local branch of the square root gives (50.6). The real/complex dichotomy and the scaling (50.7) follow immediately from the sign of s(\lambda) for \lambda near \lambda_*. ∎

Corollary 50.1 — “Complex escape” is locally a square-root bifurcation

Under the hypotheses of Lemma 50, any creation/annihilation of a nonreal conjugate pair occurs with \Im t scaling like \sqrt{|\lambda-\lambda_*|}, and cannot occur without a real double zero.
