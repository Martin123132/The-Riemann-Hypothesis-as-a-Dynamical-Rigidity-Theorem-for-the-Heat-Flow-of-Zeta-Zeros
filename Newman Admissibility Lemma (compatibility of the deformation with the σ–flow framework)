Step 60 — Newman Admissibility Lemma (compatibility of the deformation with the σ–flow framework)

Goal.
Show that the de Bruijn–Newman deformation Xi_λ(t) is an admissible one-parameter family to which the zero-tracking + implicit-function + collision/escape logic applies.

Notation.
Let ξ(s) be Riemann’s xi-function and define the standard entire even function
    Xi(t) := ξ(1/2 + i t).
Let Φ(x) be the (even, rapidly decaying) kernel such that Xi is the cosine transform of Φ:
    Xi(t) = ∫_0^∞ Φ(x) cos(tx) dx.
For λ ∈ ℝ define the Newman deformation
    Xi_λ(t) := ∫_0^∞ e^{λ x^2} Φ(x) cos(tx) dx.
(Equivalent descriptions exist; this is the one aligned with your quadrature implementation.)

Lemma 60 (Admissibility of Newman flow).
The family (t,λ) ↦ Xi_λ(t) satisfies:

(A1) For each fixed λ, Xi_λ(t) is an entire function of t, real-valued for real t, and even in t.
(A2) The map (t,λ) ↦ Xi_λ(t) is jointly real-analytic on ℝ×I for any interval I where the defining integral converges absolutely (in particular for all λ ≤ 0, and for small λ > 0 within a controlled truncation of Φ).
(A3) The parameter derivative exists and is given by
        ∂_λ Xi_λ(t) = ∫_0^∞ x^2 e^{λ x^2} Φ(x) cos(tx) dx,
    and is continuous in (t,λ) on ℝ×I.
(A4) Xi_λ satisfies the heat equation in the (t,λ) variables:
        ∂_λ Xi_λ(t) = - ∂_{tt} Xi_λ(t),
    i.e. λ plays the role of “backward heat time” (sign convention fixed by the cosine transform).
(A5) If t_i(λ0) is a simple real zero of Xi_{λ0}, then there exists a unique C^1 trajectory t_i(λ) in a neighborhood of λ0 with Xi_λ(t_i(λ))=0 and
        dt_i/dλ = - (∂_λ Xi_λ / ∂_t Xi_λ)(t_i(λ),λ).

Proof sketch.
(A1) Entirety in t follows because cos(tx) is entire in t and Φ decays rapidly, allowing termwise differentiation under the integral; reality and evenness follow from cos being even and real on ℝ and Φ being real.
(A2) Joint real-analyticity follows from dominated convergence applied to all mixed derivatives in t and λ, using rapid decay of Φ and boundedness of e^{λ x^2} on λ≤0 (for λ>0 one restricts to regimes where the integral representation is valid or uses an equivalent entire continuation).
(A3) Differentiate under the integral sign; domination is provided by x^2|Φ(x)|e^{λ x^2} which is integrable on λ≤0.
(A4) Differentiate twice in t under the integral:
    ∂_{tt} Xi_λ(t) = ∫_0^∞ e^{λ x^2} Φ(x) ∂_{tt}cos(tx) dx
                   = ∫_0^∞ e^{λ x^2} Φ(x) ( -x^2 cos(tx) ) dx
                   = - ∂_λ Xi_λ(t).
(A5) Apply the implicit function theorem to Xi_λ(t) at (t_i(λ0),λ0) using simplicity (∂_t Xi_λ ≠ 0). ∎


Corollary 60.1 (Collision ↔ complex-pair birth for Newman flow).
Because Xi_λ is real entire and analytic in (t,λ), a complex conjugate pair can only be created/annihilated at a parameter value λ* where Xi_{λ*} has a multiple real zero:
    Xi_{λ*}(t*)=0 and ∂_t Xi_{λ*}(t*)=0.
Thus: “complex escape requires a real collision” holds for Xi_λ exactly.

Corollary 60.2 (Zero ODE for Newman flow).
On any interval where all zeros are simple and real, each tracked zero satisfies
    dt_i/dλ = + (Xi_{λ,tt}/Xi_{λ,t})(t_i(λ),λ)
(up to the chosen heat-sign convention), and the local singular part of the generator is fixed by the Hadamard pole sum exactly as in the σ–heat case.
