Formal Core: σ–Flow Lemmas for Riemann Zero Dynamics

Setup (fixed for all lemmas)

Let
F(t,\sigma) := \bigl(\mathcal S_\sigma Z\bigr)(t)
where Z(t) is the Riemann–Siegel Z-function and \mathcal S_\sigma denotes Gaussian smoothing with variance \sigma^2, implemented spectrally (equivalently: the heat semigroup).

Assume:
	•	F(\cdot,\sigma) is real-valued on \mathbb R,
	•	F(\cdot,\sigma) is entire in t for each fixed \sigma>0,
	•	F satisfies the heat equation
\partial_\sigma F = c\,\partial_{tt} F
for some fixed constant c>0 (normalisation irrelevant).

Let \{t_i(\sigma)\} denote the real zeros of F(\cdot,\sigma), indexed in increasing order, and assume simplicity unless stated otherwise.

Lemma 1 — Zero tracking and differentiability

Lemma.
If t_i(\sigma_0) is a simple zero of F(\cdot,\sigma_0), then there exists an open interval I\ni\sigma_0 and a unique C^1 function t_i:I\to\mathbb R such that
F(t_i(\sigma),\sigma)=0\quad\forall\sigma\in I.

Moreover,
\frac{d t_i}{d\sigma}
=
-\frac{\partial_\sigma F}{\partial_t F}
\Big|_{(t_i(\sigma),\sigma)}.

Proof.
Immediate from the implicit function theorem applied to F(t,\sigma), using simplicity of the zero to guarantee \partial_t F\neq 0. ∎

Lemma 2 — Heat-flow generator for zeros

Lemma.
Under the heat equation \partial_\sigma F=cF_{tt}, the zero trajectories satisfy
\boxed{
\frac{d t_i}{d\sigma}
=
-\,c\,\frac{F_{tt}}{F_t}
\Big|_{t=t_i(\sigma)}.
}

Proof.
Substitute \partial_\sigma F=cF_{tt} into Lemma 1. ∎

This identity is exact and contains the full σ-dynamics of the zeros.

⸻

Lemma 3 — Log-derivative expansion at a simple real zero

Lemma.
Suppose F(\cdot,\sigma) is a real entire function whose zeros \{t_j(\sigma)\} are all real and simple. Then at any zero t_i(\sigma),
\frac{F_{tt}}{F_t}(t_i)
=
2\sum_{j\neq i}\frac{1}{t_i-t_j}
+
A(\sigma),
where A(\sigma) is a σ-dependent constant arising from the exponential prefactor in the canonical product of F.

Proof.
By the Hadamard factorisation theorem, F admits a canonical product
F(t)=e^{a t+b}\prod_j\left(1-\frac{t}{t_j}\right)e^{t/t_j}.
Taking \partial_t\log F and then differentiating again, evaluation at t=t_i yields
\frac{F_{tt}}{F_t}(t_i)
=
2\sum_{j\neq i}\frac{1}{t_i-t_j}
+
2a,
with A(\sigma)=2a(\sigma). ∎

⸻

Lemma 4 — Odd-kernel zero dynamics

Lemma.
Combining Lemmas 2 and 3, the σ-flow of zeros obeys
\boxed{
\frac{d t_i}{d\sigma}
=
-2c\sum_{j\neq i}\frac{1}{t_i-t_j}
-
c\,A(\sigma).
}

The interaction term is antisymmetric and purely odd in pairwise separations.

Proof.
Immediate substitution. ∎

This equation is the exact continuum origin of the odd-kernel structure observed numerically.

⸻

Lemma 5 — Order preservation and collision obstruction

Lemma.
Assume that for σ in an interval I:
	1.	all zeros are real and simple,
	2.	zero dynamics obey Lemma 4.

Then for all \sigma\in I,
t_{i+1}(\sigma)-t_i(\sigma) > 0,
and no two zeros can collide in finite σ-time.

Proof.
Let \Delta_i=t_{i+1}-t_i. Subtract the equations for t_{i+1} and t_i. The dominant contribution near \Delta_i\to 0 is
\frac{d\Delta_i}{d\sigma}
\sim
\frac{2c}{\Delta_i} + O(1),
which diverges positively as \Delta_i\to 0. Hence \Delta_i cannot vanish in finite σ. ∎

⸻

Lemma 6 — Collision necessity for complex escape

Lemma.
Let F(\cdot,\sigma) be real entire and analytic in (t,\sigma). If a pair of complex conjugate zeros is created or annihilated as σ varies, then at the transition point (t^\*,\sigma^\*),
F(t^\*,\sigma^\*)=0,
\quad
\partial_t F(t^\*,\sigma^\*)=0.

Proof.
Standard consequence of analyticity: birth or death of a conjugate pair requires a multiple real zero. ∎

⸻

Lemma 7 — No collisions ⇒ no complex escape

Lemma.
If there exists \sigma_1>0 such that:
	1.	all zeros of F(\cdot,\sigma_1) are real and simple,
	2.	Lemma 4 governs zero dynamics for 0\le\sigma\le\sigma_1,

then all zeros remain real for all \sigma\in[0,\sigma_1].

Proof.
By Lemma 5, collisions are impossible. By Lemma 6, complex escape requires a collision. Therefore escape cannot occur. ∎
