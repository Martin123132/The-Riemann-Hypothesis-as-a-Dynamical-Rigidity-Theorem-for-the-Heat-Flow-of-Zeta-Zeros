WRITE-UP (what we’ve established so far, in-order)

SETUP
- We sample a real signal on the critical line:
    f(t) = Re ξ(1/2 + i t)
  over finite windows (notably [60,120], later [120,180]) with N-point grids (8192 / 16384).

- We locate “baseline zeros” by sign-change bracketing + refinement, then apply operators to f(t) and re-locate the transformed zeros.
  Define Δt_i = (zero_i^new − zero_i^base) after matching/tracking.

A) SANITY: multiplicative vs additive / convolution operators
- Pure multiplicative reweightings (pointwise) can preserve zero locations (as expected when factor has no zeros/sign flips on window).
- Non-multiplicative smoothing (direct convolution in t with Gaussian) moves zeros substantially, and the drift grows with σ / τ.
  → “zero rigidity” is NOT a generic consequence of “smooth spectral manipulation”; it is operator-dependent.

B) LOCAL-DERIVATIVE PREDICTION ATTEMPT
- Tried predicting Δt from local Taylor structure (f, f’, f’’ type heuristics).
- Measured Δt is ~O(10^-1 to 10^0) under convolution while predicted Δt is tiny (often ~10^-3…10^-2).
  → local-only curvature/Taylor models do not explain the observed drift under convolution.

C1 / C1b GLOBAL BALANCE CHECKS
- C1 (well-matched sets): small mean shifts (~10^-3…10^-2) can be quantified cleanly via ΣΔt and Σ|Δt|.
- C1b (mismatch catastrophe): when zero counts change / matching fails, ΣΔt blows up and becomes meaningless.
  → matching/tracking quality is critical; “global balance” metrics are only valid with consistent pairing.

D) PHASE-ONLY FOURIER MASKS (global / band / odd/even)
- Phase-only spectral deformations generally destroy the zero set in-window:
  either you get almost no zeros or an explosion of spurious zeros, with huge mean |Δt|.
  → strong veto against “pure phase deformation explains rigidity”.

E) REAL EVEN ZERO-MEAN KERNELS
- Tested even kernels: Gaussian vs Mexican-hat (zero mean).
- Both move zeros; Mexican-hat tends to be “gentler” than Gaussian at same σ.
- Mean |Δt| behaves roughly like a power in σ (reference σ^2 line included).

HARD SPECTRAL PROJECTION
- Symmetric low-pass (“hard projection” |k|≤kc both sides) produces very small zero drift (mean |Δt| ~ 10^-3).
  → symmetric bandlimiting is surprisingly “rigid” compared to many other transforms.

ASYMMETRIC PROJECTIONS & “REPAIR”
- One-sided / asymmetric spectral selection causes catastrophic loss of zeros and huge drift.
- “Repair by conjugate symmetry” still produces pathological zero sets (thousands of zeros) and large drift.

GAUSSIAN SEMIGROUP CHECK
- Verified function-level semigroup consistency:
    G(σ1)∘G(σ2) ≈ G(√(σ1^2+σ2^2))
  with tiny relative error at function level,
  yet zero maps do not compose cleanly.
  → zeros are not a simple “state” under the semigroup; tracking/matching matters and branching occurs.

ZERO TRAJECTORIES UNDER σ-FLOW
- Track zeros continuously as σ increases (Gaussian flow).
- Observed smooth Δt_i(σ) curves; mean initial |∂t/∂σ| is finite.
- σ-additivity test:
    Δt(σ1+σ2) = Δt(σ1) + Δt(σ2)
  holds essentially exactly in tracked coordinates.
  → strong evidence that (for tracked zeros) the flow is generated by a σ-generator: dt/dσ = v(t).

INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY TEST
- Measured “instantaneous” v_i = Δt/Δσ at small σ.
- A simple local predictor gave moderate correlation (~0.54) but large relative error (~0.77).
  → there is real structure, but local-only is insufficient.

DENSITY / NONLOCAL PAIR TESTS
- Residual vs density gradient: weak/moderate correlation (~0.37).
- Hilbert / repulsion kernel test: small correlation (~ -0.11).
- Dyson–Brownian covariance: mild correlation (~0.29).
  → nonlocal interactions exist but naive forms are not capturing the generator cleanly.

I / I′ / I″ (ANTISYMMETRIC BALANCE & POTENTIAL)
- Built antisymmetric covariance balance S_i with Σ S_i ≈ 0 (machine precision), and strong shape stability under σ-flow (corr ~ 0.9996).
- Potential reconstruction from S_i had ~0.33 relative reconstruction error (promising but not closed).

J (LOG-ANALYTIC GENERATOR CHECK)
- Tested whether S_i correlates with d/dt log|xi| or d/dt log|zeta’|.
- Very low R² (~0.01…0.02).
  → not simply a local log-derivative of xi or zeta’.

K (KERNEL IDENTIFICATION — ODD vs EVEN)
- Fit dt (demeaned) to odd-kernel families:
    H_p(i) = Σ_{j≠i} sign(t_i−t_j)/|t_i−t_j|^p
- Odd kernels outperform even controls strongly.
- Best single p often around p≈3–4; multi-kernel (H1+H3+...) can reach high R² on small samples.
  → generator has a strong “odd Hilbert-like” nonlocal component.

L / M / N / O (TRANSPORT / REVERSAL / ACCEL / PROJECTION)
- Generator transport between σ1 and σ2 failed (R² ~ 0).
- Time reversal weak (corr ~ 0.38) with fixed relative error (~2).
- σ-acceleration vs kernel force weak (corr ~ 0.04).
- Projection of dt onto H3 removes that component but leaves a large residual (~0.99 of norm).
  → the generator is not just a single H3 force; constraints exist but aren’t closing as a simple transport law.

P / Q (LOW-RANK & LOO)
- Low rank reconstruction can trivially fit tiny N (overfit; R²=1 with few points).
- Leave-one-out on small N is poor (relative err ~2.8).
  → must use larger tracked sets; LOO is the right sanity check.

R (ACTION / ROUGHNESS OVER σ PATH)
- Computed action-like measures along σ-trajectory and curvature ratio A/Amin.
- Most zeros near straight-line drift (median ratio ~1.34) but a few outliers explode (ratio ~10^3+).
  → suggests occasional “events” (near-collisions / tracking ambiguity / mode-mixing) that create high curvature paths.

S (σ-LINEARITY)
- Confirmed exact additivity of tracked Δt in σ (a major structural constraint).

T / U / V / W / X / Y / Z / AA′ / AB / AC / AD / AE (GENERATOR & TRANSFER PROGRAM)
- Extract σ-generator:
    v_i ≈ dt_i/dσ at σ≈0 using small-σ fits (robust extraction).
- U: generator across spectral bands is consistent up to scale (corr ~0.96, residual small).
- W: commutator between two generator estimates ~0 (consistent with single underlying generator).
- X/Y: estimated generator spectrum has small Re parts; Im parts show weak/moderate scaling with spacing (corr ~0.54 with 1/Δ̄).
- Z/AA′/AB: odd-kernel coefficient vectors a_p transfer extremely well window-to-window (corr(aA,aB) ~ 0.9996),
  while raw v(t) transfers poorly under naive index alignment (structure is there but needs correct mapping).
- AC: translation covariance holds extremely strongly for fitted a_p (rel.std ~1e-16) → generator is translation-covariant.
- AD: scale covariance shows a_p scale like λ^p (estimated α≈p) → extremely strong evidence the basis is truly homogeneous.
- AE: coefficients vs σ (RG-like flow) shows weak coupling; β trends are not yet stable (needs more σ points / better conditioning).

BOTTOM LINE SO FAR
- A real σ-generator exists: dt/dσ = v(t) with exact σ-additivity for tracked zeros.
- v(t) contains a strong nonlocal odd-kernel component with homogeneous scaling (p-homogeneity) and translation covariance.
- The remaining work is: close the law for v(t) (or its renormalized form) beyond a fitted odd-kernel ansatz, and stabilize transfer/matching across windows without overfit.
